## Explaination


- ### This Tic Tac Toe games is build on Laravel 11, Vue.js and Inertia.js.
- ### To simplify, I have used setInterval every two seconds, but I have prepared this solution to use Pusher to notify user about the change on the other side, and to update the board.
- ### Used Sqlite to store the values of the game.
